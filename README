prentice - apprentice wizard roguelike or rather at this point a demo
of how an Entity Component System (ECS) can be written using SQLite
and TCL[1]

to build and run on OpenBSD 6.6

  doas pkg_add tcl-8.5.19p4 sqlite3-tcl-3.24.0
  make
  ./prentice

other OS will require other commands and other amounts of work

notable files include:

 * game.db - a copy of the database may get saved here; inpsect with
   `sqlite3 game.db` or any other tool that understands sqlite
   database files
 * init.tcl - where most everything for the ECS is
 * log - where STDERR from the program is sent
 * main.c - bootstraps ncurses and TCL
 * main.tcl - main game loop (see instead init.tcl)
