prentice - apprentice wizard roguelike

or rather at this point a demo of how an ECS could be written using sqlite

TCL and TCL support for sqlite3 are requried, e.g. on OpenBSD 6.5

    doas pkg_add tcl-8.5.19p4 sqlite3-tcl-3.24.0

a redirect of stderr is advised so that stderr does not mesh with
whatever is going on in the raw terminal:

    make prentice
    ./prentice 2>log
