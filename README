prentice - apprentice wizard roguelike or rather at this point a demo of
how an Entity Component System (ECS) could be written using SQLite and
TCL[1] where the SQL is mostly used to store data and the logic is
mostly all in TCL (as opposed to putting all the logic or even the
display code into database triggers)

to build and run on OpenBSD 6.6

  doas pkg_add tcl-8.6.8p2 sqlite3-tcl-3.24.0
  make
  ./prentice

or to automatically see the log in the unlikely event that
something blows up,

  make && ./prentice || less log

other OS will require other commands and other amounts of work

notable files include:

 * game.db - a copy of the database is saved here; inspect this with
   `sqlite3 game.db` or any other tool that understands sqlite
   database files
 * init.tcl - where most of the code is
 * log - STDERR from the program ends up here
 * main.c - bootstraps ncurses and TCL
 * main.tcl - the main game loop (see instead init.tcl)
