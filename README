prentice - apprentice wizard roguelike

TCL and TCL support for sqlite3 are requried, e.g. on OpenBSD 6.5

    doas pkg_add tcl-8.5.19p4 sqlite3-tcl-3.24.0

redirect of stderr advised so it does not mesh with whatever is going on
in the raw terminal:

    make depend
    make prentice
    ./prentice 2>log

due to `main.tcl` this can only be run (for now) from the build directory
